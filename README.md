## 📌 Highlighted Projects

### 🔷 [MiniRT](https://github.com/AntonSplavnik/miniRT) *(in progress)*
A raytracing engine written in pure C. Working on light simulation, camera movement, and BVH acceleration. A deep dive into graphics rendering and performance.

### 🔹 [Minishell](https://github.com/AntonSplavnik/minishell)
A Unix-like shell built in C. Supports pipelines, redirection, signals, and environment variables using `fork`, `execve`, and `dup2`.  
→ Built from scratch with a focus on process control and signal handling.

### 🔸 [Philosophers](https://github.com/AntonSplavnik/philosophers)
A multithreading simulation of the classic Dining Philosophers problem using POSIX threads and mutexes.  
→ Focused on concurrency, timing precision, and avoiding deadlocks.
