Currently studying at 42 Berlin.  
Exploring the low-level side of programming and how systems connect — from C-powered renderers to Unity-driven game loops.



## Game Development · Unity / C#

Designing small, mechanic-focused games built for responsiveness and iteration.

- [**Cube D**](https://github.com/AntonSplavnik/cube-d)  - A minimalist 3D runner. Navigate obstacles, level up, and unlock content in a clean Unity setup.

- [**Kebabb Maker**](https://github.com/AntonSplavnik/kebabb-maker)  - A fast-paced cooking prototype. Assemble orders against the clock using real-time logic and dynamic UI.



## Systems Projects · C / C++

Digging into system calls, concurrency, and rendering — with a strong focus on clarity and performance.

- [**Ray Tracer**](https://github.com/AntonSplavnik/miniRT)  - A simple raytracer written in C. Handles lights, cameras, objects, and acceleration structures.

- [**Mini shell**](https://github.com/AntonSplavnik/minishell)  - A Unix shell clone built from scratch. Implements piping, redirection, signals, and process management.

- [**Philosophers**](https://github.com/AntonSplavnik/philosophers)  - A POSIX-threaded simulation of the dining philosophers problem. Explores mutexes, timing, and deadlock prevention.
